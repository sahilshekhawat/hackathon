Aim of this project is to create a WEB app which can track the location 
of the students of IIIT-Delhi so that they can actually see where their
FRIENDS are.


It works by using Google Maps API along with geolocation feature of the 
browser. This way students can use it on their mobiles phones as well on 
their laptops leaving the positioning to the GOOGLE.
Now we can actually tell where a person is in the real time.
