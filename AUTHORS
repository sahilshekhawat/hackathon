Aim of this project is to create a WEB app which can track the location 
of the students of IIIT-Delhi so that they can actually see where their
FRIENDS are.

It works on a script which have the location of all the WI-FI routers
and which actually can find the nearest wifi router of the student.
This leads to the approximate positioning without using wifi.
The sole requirement is that the target must be connected to wifi.

It can be further improved by introducing triangulation which could 
lead to better approximation.
